\title{Attach jQuery to an HTML Document for r2resize Components}
\usage{
add.JQuery(version = "3.5.1")
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{A character string specifying the desired jQuery version (e.g., "3.5.1", "3.7.0").
Defaults to "3.5.1" if no version is provided. Ensure the version specified is available on the jQuery CDN.}
}
\value{
An HTML `<script>` tag as a character string, with `html` and `character` classes, containing the link to the jQuery library.
}
\description{
This function dynamically includes the jQuery library into an HTML output. It's particularly useful when
other functions within the `r2resize` package, which rely on jQuery, are used in an environment (like a knitted R Markdown document
or a Shiny application) where jQuery might not be automatically present or where a specific version is required.
}
\details{
The `add.JQuery` function generates a `<script>` HTML tag that links to a specified version of the jQuery library
from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). By calling this function, you ensure that the necessary jQuery functionalities
are available for `r2resize`'s interactive components, such as those used in `splitCard`, `sizeableCard`, or `windowCard`.
This function adds the `html` and `character` classes to the output, making it compatible with `htmltools::htmlDependency`
and other HTML rendering contexts in R.
}
\note{
This function is crucial for maintaining the robustness and reliability of the `r2resize` package.
It acts as a fallback mechanism, ensuring that interactive functionalities remain operational even
when jQuery is not explicitly included in the HTML page by default. This enhances the package's
ability to gracefully handle diverse HTML environments, facilitating seamless integration and usage.
}
\examples{
# Attach the default jQuery version (3.5.1)
r2resize::add.JQuery()

# Attach a specific jQuery version (e.g., 3.7.0)
r2resize::add.JQuery("3.7.0")

# This function is often used implicitly by other r2resize components,
# but can be manually added to ensure jQuery is present in a custom HTML context.

# Example in a simple R Markdown chunk (won't render fully without proper setup)
\dontrun{
r2resize::add.JQuery()
htmltools::div("This text requires jQuery for some interactive features.")
}
