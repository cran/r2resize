Description: Offers a suite of tools designed to enhance the responsiveness and interactivity of web-based documents and applications created with R. It provides an automatic, configurable resizing toolbar that can be seamlessly integrated with HTML elements such as containers, images, and tables, allowing end-users to dynamically adjust their dimensions. Beyond the toolbar, the package includes a rich collection of flexible, expandable, and interactive container functionalities, such as highly customizable split-screen layouts (splitCard), versatile sizeable cards (sizeableCard), dynamic window-like elements (windowCard), visually engaging emphasis cards (empahsisCard), and sophisticated flexible and elastic card layouts (flexCard, elastiCard). Furthermore, it offers an elegant image viewer and resizer (shinyExpandImage) perfect for interactive galleries. r2resize is particularly well-suited for developers and data scientists looking to create modern, responsive, and user-friendly 'shiny' applications, 'markdown' reports, and 'quarto' documents that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and user preferences, significantly improving the user experience.
